# ACF-toggleable-marker-infowindows

This code builds on the code provided by the [ACF documentation](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/google-map/). This will be very useful especially for maps that have multiple markers and toggling between the popup windows causes information to overlap. The js file will also show you how to trigger the popups without needing to click on the map itself and show you how to add a custom icon to the map.  

Example of code in action can be found on Codepen [View Pen](https://codepen.io/aj372/pen/MvKgvz)

I also wrote a [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@hurricane.interactive/acf-multiple-map-markers-with-toggleable-infowindow-popups-efb296d0f529) about editing the script and go through in detail about all the changes made.
